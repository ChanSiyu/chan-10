    From function void Foam::cellCuts::setFromCellCutter(const Foam::cellLooper&, const Foam::List<Foam::refineCell>&)
    in file meshCut/cellCuts/cellCuts.C at line 2393
    Found loop on cell 15098 that resulted in an unexpected bad cut.
    Suggestions:
      - Turn on the debug switch for 'cellCuts' to get geometry files that identify this cell.
      - Also keep in mind to check the defined reference directions, as these are most likely the origin of the problem.

Writing refined cells (30080) to cellSet "constant/polyMesh/sets/refinedCells"

Writing map from new to old cell to "0/polyMesh/cellMap"
